   My CircuitPython Assignments. 
   These are my CircuitPython assignments from Engineering 3
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 ## Hello Circuit Python (and Metro and Mu)
 
 ### Description
 In this assignment, we are introduced to CircuitPython, Metro, and Mu. The objective is to make an LED fade from 0% to 100% brightness and back down.
 
 ### Lessons Learned
  This assignment was essentailly and introduction to Metro, CircuitPython, and Mu. I learned that the logic for your code will be nearly identical for an LED Fade across languages, but the syntax can be wildly different; as in the contrast between Arduino and CircutPython. Also, I learned that CircuitPython requires much more libraries to be imported than Arudino

 ## CircuitPython Servo (With Capacitive Touch)
 ### Description
 In this assignment, we used CircuitPythons's "Capacitive Touch" to make a Servo turn. When we touch a wire, then the servo will rotate a certain direction. If we were to touch another wire, then the Servo would rotate the other direction.
 ### Lessons Learned
 This lesson, we learned how to use PWM, as well as re-familiarizing ourselves with how CircuitPython Works. Capacitive touch was relatively easy to become accustomed to (Touch.io)
